nodefirmware(8) -- Report firmware information on confluent nodes
=================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`nodefirmware <noderange> [list][update [--backup <file>]]|[<components>]`  

## DESCRIPTION

`nodefirmware` reports and updates various firmware on nodes.  By default it
will retrieve all firmware, but can be directed to fetch specific firmware by
calling out the name of the firmware (e.g. uefi or xcc) or request reading only
core firmware firmware by using the word 'core', which is generally a quicker
operation.  Different hardwaremanagement.method indicated plugins may have
different capabilities available.  For example, the 'core' distinction may
not be relevant to redfish.  Additionally, the Lenovo XCC makes certain
information available over IPMI that is not otherwise available (for example
the FPGA version where applicable).

In the update form, it accepts a single file and attempts to update it using
the out of band facilities.  Firmware updates can end in one of three states:

* `error`: The attempted update encountered an error that prevented successful install.  Nodes experiencing this state will be reported at the end and more detail on the error will be given
* `pending`:  The firmware update process has completed, but the firmware will not be active until the relevant component next resets.  Generally speaking, for UEFI update the system will need a reboot, and for BMC updates, the `nodebmcreset` command will begin the process to activate the firmware.
* `complete`:  The firmware update process has completed and activation has proceeded.  Note that while the activation process has commenced, the component may still be in the process of rebooting when nodefirmware exits.

## OPTIONS

* `-b`, `--backup`:
  Target a backup bank rather than primary
  
* `-m MAXNODES`, `--maxnodes=MAXNODES`:
  Specify a maximum number of nodes to run the command with, prompting if over
  the threshold
  
* `-h`, `--help`:
  Show help message and exit 

## EXAMPLES
